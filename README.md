Jest is used to test classes that extend from the Employee class to ensure that they contain all neccesary functionality

```js
describe('Engineer', () => {
    describe('Initialization', () => {
        it('Should create an object with a name, id, email, and attached', () => {
            const engineer = new Engineer('Jake', '3242', 'fake@email.com', 'carmart7')
    
            expect(engineer.name).toEqual('Jake');
            expect(engineer.id).toEqual('3242');
            expect(engineer.email).toEqual('fake@email.com');
            expect(engineer.github).toEqual('carmart7');
        });
    });
});
```
